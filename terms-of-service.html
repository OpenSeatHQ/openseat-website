            <p>Thank you for choosing OpenSeat! These Organizer Terms of Service ("Terms") form a legally binding agreement between <strong>you</strong> ("Organizer," "you," or "your") and <strong>OpenSeat LLC</strong> ("OpenSeat," "we," "us," or "our").</p>
            <p>These Terms apply when you use OpenSeat to create, promote, or manage events and to sell tickets through our platform (the "Platform"), including via our website, mobile app, or any other tools, portals, or checkout interfaces we provide.</p>

            (2) through a direct relationship or invitation initiated by OpenSeat.</p>
            <p>Submitting an application does not guarantee approval. We reserve the right to approve, deny, or delay Organizer access at our sole discretion, regardless of the method of request.</p>

            <h3>1.4 Use of Application Data</h3>
            <p>We may collect and store the personal and business information you provide during the application or onboarding process. This may include your name, company name, contact details, and other relevant information. We use this information for purposes such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Evaluating your eligibility</li>
                <li>Preventing fraud or abuse</li>

                <li>Maintaining the integrity of the Platform</li>

            <h2>2. Our Relationship With You</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Overview</h3>
            <p>OpenSeat is <strong>not</strong> an event organizer, producer, or venue operator.</p>
            <p>OpenSeat provides a software platform to help you list, promote, and sell tickets to your events. OpenSeat does not operate as an event organizer, producer, venue, promoter, or co-sponsor of any kind.</p>
            <p>You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for your event, including its safety, legality, compliance, and delivery. OpenSeat is not involved in managing the venue, issuing permits, handling insurance, or overseeing event logistics.</p>
            <p>OpenSeat does not assume any liability for issues arising from your event, including but not limited to: cancellations, postponements, injuries, regulatory violations, refund disputes, or claims from attendees. You are fully and independently accountable for resolving any such issues.</p>
            
            <h3>2.2 Identity Verification and Risk Review</h3>
            <p>As part of the onboarding and ongoing use of the Platform, you agree to provide accurate and complete information, and to undergo any identity verification, risk assessment, or fraud-prevention screening required by OpenSeat or our payment processor.</p>
            <p>OpenSeat reserves the right to delay or deny access to Organizer tools if we determine, at our sole discretion, that there is a risk of fraud, misuse, or legal noncompliance. You agree that we may share relevant information with our payment processor or compliance vendors to facilitate these reviews.</p>

            <h2>3. Fees, Payments & Payouts</h2>
            <h3>3.1 Organizer Fees</h3>
            <p>Organizer fees are not fixed and may vary by venue or event. We will agree to fees with you <strong>in writing</strong> (e.g., by email or contract).</p>
            <h3>3.2 Buyer Fees</h3>
            <p>OpenSeat may charge service fees to ticket buyers. These appear clearly at checkout and are added on top of the ticket price.</p>
            <h3>3.3 Payouts</h3>
            <p>All payments and payouts are processed through <strong>Stripe</strong>, our third-party payment processor. OpenSeat does <strong>not</strong> receive, hold, or control the funds from ticket sales.</p>
            <p>To receive payouts, you must maintain a valid and verified Stripe account connected to the OpenSeat Platform. Stripe may apply its own fees, hold policies, or account restrictions in accordance with its terms of service.</p>
            <p>You may access certain payout or refund tools through your Stripe dashboard; however, refunds issued directly through Stripe are not covered by OpenSeat's platform policies and may cause discrepancies or disputes unless consistent with your stated refund policy.</p>

            <h2>4. Refunds, Chargebacks & Cancellations</h2>
            <h3>4.1 Refunds</h3>
            <p>You are solely responsible for establishing and honoring your refund policy. OpenSeat does not issue refunds on your behalf and has no obligation to mediate disputes between you and ticket buyers.</p>
            <p>You must ensure that your refund terms comply with applicable consumer protection laws in your event's location. If you cancel or materially change your event, you are obligated to notify attendees and issue refunds promptly, unless prohibited by law or disclosed otherwise at purchase.</p>
            <p>If you fail to issue required refunds, OpenSeat may (but is not obligated to) intervene, and you agree to reimburse us for any amounts paid to buyers, including related fees or chargeback penalties.</p>
            <h3>4.2 Refund Policy for Active Events</h3>
            <p>For events that are not canceled, you may set your own refund policy, as long as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is displayed on your event page, and</li>
                <li>It follows applicable laws.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4.3 Chargebacks</h3>
            <p>You are financially responsible for any chargebacks or payment disputes arising from your ticket sales. Stripe may debit OpenSeat for such amounts, and if so, we will invoice you. You must reimburse us within 7 days of notice.</p>
            <p>To reduce chargebacks, you must clearly disclose your refund policy on your event page and respond to buyer inquiries in a timely manner.</p>
            <h3>4.4 Event Cancellations</h3>
            <p>If your event is canceled, postponed, or materially changed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You must notify attendees.</li>
                <li>You must issue refunds accordingly.</li>
                <li>You are responsible for any claims arising from the cancellation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4.5 Refund Policy Display Requirement</h3>
            <p>Refunds may only be issued as full refunds for individual tickets. OpenSeat does not support percentage-based or partial refunds (e.g., refunding 50% of a ticket price). While it may be technically possible for you to process such refunds directly through Stripe, doing so is outside of OpenSeat's platform and policy framework, and may result in customer confusion, chargebacks, or account review.</p>
            <p>You agree to follow OpenSeat's refund structure and to issue only full refunds for individual tickets through the Platform. Partial refunds for individual tickets are not permitted. If a customer purchases multiple tickets in a single order, you may refund one or more of those tickets individually, but not a portion of a single ticket's price.</p>
            <p>You are responsible for clearly stating your refund policy on each event listing. If no refund policy is provided, buyers may be entitled to a full refund under applicable law.</p>

            <h2>5. Your Responsibilities as an Organizer</h2>
            <p>You are responsible for scanning tickets and ensuring your entry process prevents duplicate or fraudulent scans. OpenSeat does not control on-site access and is not responsible for entry decisions, delays, or disputes related to ticket validation.</p>
            <p>Additionally, you are solely responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Event safety and security</li>
                <li>Venue compliance with legal and regulatory requirements</li>
                <li>Obtaining permits and licenses</li>
                <li>Enforcing age restrictions and alcohol laws</li>
                <li>Accurate event descriptions</li>
                <li>Providing customer support for the event</li>
                <li>Handling attendee disputes</li>
                <li>Ensuring your QR code scanning / entry process works smoothly</li>
                <li>Complying with privacy laws when contacting attendees</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We strongly recommend that you maintain event liability insurance appropriate for the type and size of your event. This may include general liability, venue coverage, or other relevant policies.</p>
            <p>OpenSeat does not provide or require insurance by default, but we may require proof of insurance for certain event types, venues, or Organizer profiles at our discretion.</p>
            <p>OpenSeat is not liable for any claims, damages, losses, or injuries arising from your event or your failure to obtain adequate coverage.</p>

            <h2>6. Your Content & Intellectual Property</h2>
            <h3>6.1 Your Ownership</h3>
            <p>You retain ownership of all text, images, logos, and other content you upload ("Organizer Content").</p>
            <h3>6.2 License to OpenSeat</h3>
            <p>You grant us permission to:</p>

                <li>Display your content on event pages</li>
                <li>Host and distribute it as needed</li>
                <li>Use it in promotional materials for your event</li>

            </ul>
            <p>You may revoke this license for future marketing by emailing us at <a href="mailto:contact@openseat.cc">contact@openseat.cc</a></p>
            <h3>6.3 Prohibited Content</h3>

            </ul>
            <p>We may suspend or remove such events without notice.</p>

            <h2>8. Suspension & Termination</h2>
            <p>OpenSeat may suspend or terminate your Organizer access if you:</p>

                <li>Your breach of these Terms</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>To the fullest extent allowed by law:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>OpenSeat is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.</li>
                <li>Our maximum liability is limited to the fees paid by you to OpenSeat in the past 12 months.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>11. Waiver of Liability</h2>
            <p>You acknowledge and agree that OpenSeat is not responsible for the safety, security, legality, or success of your event. You voluntarily assume all risks associated with organizing or promoting an event through the Platform.</p>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, you hereby waive and release OpenSeat and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses — including legal fees — arising out of or in connection with your event, your use of the Platform, or any attendee interactions.</p>
            <p>This waiver applies regardless of whether such claims are based in contract, tort, statute, or otherwise.</p>

            <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the <strong>State of Washington</strong>.</p>
            <p>All disputes must be handled in the state or federal courts of <strong>Clark County, Washington</strong>.</p>

            <h2>13. Data Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>You acknowledge and agree that OpenSeat may collect and process certain personal and business information provided by you (including your name, contact details, company info, and event details) in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>You are also responsible for complying with applicable data protection laws when collecting or using attendee data provided through the Platform.</p>

            <h2>14. Platform Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>OpenSeat acts solely as a neutral intermediary and technology provider. We do not endorse, control, or supervise Organizers or the events listed on the Platform.</p>
            <p>By using the Platform, you acknowledge that OpenSeat has no responsibility for the actions, inactions, or representations of any Organizer or third party, including event-related safety, compliance, customer service, or refund handling.</p>
            <p>OpenSeat expressly disclaims all liability arising from or related to any event, transaction, or dispute between Buyers and Organizers.</p>

            <p>OpenSeat is not responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performing, any obligation under these Terms due to events beyond its reasonable control. This includes, but is not limited to, natural disasters, power outages, internet failures, acts of government, civil unrest, labor shortages, pandemics, or disruptions in third-party services.</p>
            <p>Such events do not entitle any party to a refund, damages, or compensation from OpenSeat.</p>

            <h2>16. Severability</h2>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

If the changes are material, we will notify you by email or through your Organizer dashboard. Your continued use of the Platform after any updates means you accept the revised Terms.</p>
            <p>You are responsible for reviewing the current Terms before each event you create or manage.</p>

        <div id="buyer" class="tos-content">
            <div class="effective-date">
                <strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 11, 2025<br>
                <strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 11, 2025
            </div>

            <p>Welcome to OpenSeat! These Ticket Buyer Terms of Service ("Terms") form a legally binding agreement between <strong>you</strong> ("Buyer," "you," or "your") and <strong>OpenSeat LLC</strong> ("OpenSeat," "we," "us," or "our").</p>
            <p>These Terms apply whenever you purchase, access, or use a ticket through our platform (the "Platform"), including through our website, mobile app, checkout.openseat.cc, or any other purchasing interface provided by OpenSeat.</p>
            <p>By purchasing or using a ticket through OpenSeat, you agree to both these Terms and our Privacy Policy, which explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information.</p>

            <h2>1. OpenSeat's Role</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Platform Functionality</h3>
            <p>OpenSeat is a technology platform that facilitates the listing, promotion, and sale of tickets by independent event organizers ("Organizers"). We do not organize, operate, promote, or manage any events.</p>
            
            <h3>1.2 Buyer Relationship with Organizers</h3>
            <p>When you purchase a ticket through the Platform, you are entering into a direct agreement with the Organizer of that event, not with OpenSeat. We are not a party to the agreement between you and the Organizer and are not responsible for their actions or omissions.</p>
            <p>Organizers are independent third parties and are not employees, representatives, or agents of OpenSeat. OpenSeat is not responsible for the actions, omissions, or representations of any Organizer.</p>
            
            <h3>1.3 No Guarantees About Events or Organizers</h3>
            <p>OpenSeat does not guarantee the quality, safety, legality, or conduct of any event. We do not supervise events, operate venues, or ensure that events will occur as described. You acknowledge that attending an event involves risk, and that OpenSeat is not liable for any issues arising before, during, or after an event.</p>
            
            <h3>1.4 Organizer Screening and Platform Integrity</h3>
            <p>OpenSeat does not perform formal background checks on Organizers or verify the accuracy of every event listing. However, we may monitor for signs of fraud, abuse, or repeated disputes, and may suspend or remove events or Organizers at our discretion to help protect the integrity of the Platform.</p>
            
            <h3>1.5 Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>You acknowledge and agree that OpenSeat is not responsible for any acts, omissions, claims, or liabilities related to the event itself — including injuries, cancellations, refund disputes, or venue issues. All such matters are the sole responsibility of the Organizer.</p>

            <h2>2. Buying Tickets & Accessing Them</h2>
            <p>You can purchase tickets in two ways:</p>
            <h3>2.1 Purchasing on the Web (No Account Required at Checkout)</h3>
            <p>If you buy a ticket through the web checkout:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You must provide a valid <strong>email address</strong>.</li>
                <li>Your ticket will be linked to this identifier.</li>
                <li>To view your ticket in the mobile app, you will later create an account using the <strong>same email</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your information is securely stored, but a full account is created only when you log into the app.</p>
            <h3>2.2 Purchasing in the Mobile App</h3>
            <p>If you already have an OpenSeat account, you can purchase tickets directly in the app.</p>
            <h3>2.3 Ticket Delivery</h3>
            <p>All tickets are delivered digitally. You access them in the OpenSeat mobile app after logging in.</p>

            <h2>3. Email Communications</h2>
            <p>We may send you emails for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Purchase receipts</li>
                <li>Ticket delivery</li>
                <li>Event updates, cancellations, or changes</li>
                <li>Account notifications</li>
                <li>Security alerts</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Marketing emails are sent only if you explicitly opt in.</strong> You can unsubscribe anytime.</p>

            <h2>4. Payments</h2>
            <p>All payments are securely processed by <strong>Stripe</strong>, our third-party payment processor.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>OpenSeat does not store your payment card details. Your transaction is processed directly through Stripe, and may be subject to Stripe's own terms of service and privacy policy.</li>
                <li>Stripe may offer optional features such as saved payment methods or digital wallets through its Link platform.</li>
                <li>By purchasing a ticket, you acknowledge that OpenSeat is not the merchant of record and does not receive or hold your payment directly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Ticket Rules</h2>
            <h3>5.1 No Transfers or Resales</h3>
            <p>Tickets purchased through OpenSeat:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cannot be transferred</li>
                <li>Cannot be resold</li>
                <li>Cannot be exchanged</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Organizers may deny entry if you attempt to use a transferred or resold ticket.</p>
            <h3>5.2 QR Code Security</h3>
            <p>Your ticket includes a QR code. Make sure you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep it private</li>
                <li>Avoid sharing screenshots</li>
                <li>Protect your device</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If someone else accesses your code, they may gain entry before you. Only the first valid scan is honored.</p>

            <h2>6. Refunds, Cancellations & Event Issues</h2>
            <h3>6.1 Organizer Controls Refunds</h3>
            <p>Refunds are handled solely by the Organizer. OpenSeat does not determine refund eligibility, process refunds, or hold any ticket funds.</p>
            <p>By purchasing a ticket, you acknowledge and agree that OpenSeat is not responsible for issuing any refund, regardless of the reason. All refund requests, including those arising from event cancellation, schedule changes, dissatisfaction, or technical issues, must be directed to the Organizer.</p>
            <p>OpenSeat is not liable for any losses or costs arising from the Organizer's failure to issue a refund, including travel expenses or lost opportunity.</p>
            <p>OpenSeat does not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make refund decisions</li>
                <li>Process refunds on your behalf</li>
                <li>Hold funds from ticket sales</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>6.2 Refund Policy for Active Events</h3>
            <p>Refund rules are set by the Organizer and displayed on the event page. By buying a ticket, you accept that policy.</p>
            <h3>6.3 QR Code Security</h3>
            <p>Each ticket includes a unique QR code that serves as your entry credential. You are solely responsible for keeping this code secure. Do not share, screenshot, or post your QR code online or send it to others.</p>
            <p>Only the first scan of a valid QR code will be honored for entry. If someone else accesses your code and uses it before you arrive, you may be denied entry, and no replacement or refund will be issued.</p>
            <p>OpenSeat is not responsible for lost, stolen, copied, or misused QR codes. Entry decisions are made solely by the event Organizer or venue staff.</p>
            <h3>6.4 Entry Disputes</h3>
            <p>If you are denied entry to an event for any reason — including invalid, duplicate, or previously scanned tickets — you must resolve the issue directly with the Organizer or venue staff. OpenSeat does not make entry decisions and is not responsible for resolving disputes at the event.</p>
            <p>We do not issue refunds or provide credits for denied entry.</p>
            <h3>6.5 Cancellations or Major Changes</h3>
            <p>If an event is canceled, postponed, or materially changed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Organizer is responsible for notifying you.</li>
                <li>The Organizer must issue refunds as required.</li>
                <li>OpenSeat is not responsible for the refund amount or timeline.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>6.6 Chargebacks</h3>
            <p>If you dispute a payment through your bank or card issuer (a "chargeback"), you understand and agree that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Organizer, not OpenSeat, is financially responsible for the transaction.</li>
                <li>OpenSeat may pause or cancel your access to the ticket until the dispute is resolved.</li>
                <li>You agree not to initiate a chargeback for non-fraud-related reasons, such as event dissatisfaction or cancellation, and to first attempt resolution directly with the Organizer.</li>
                <li>Improper or abusive chargebacks may result in suspension of your OpenSeat account and restriction from future purchases.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>6.7 No Guarantee of Event Conditions</h3>
            <p>You acknowledge that attending an event involves risks outside OpenSeat's control. We make no guarantees about the event's quality, safety, or experience. You assume full responsibility for your attendance and any associated costs.</p>
            <p>If the Organizer fails to deliver the event as advertised, your sole remedy is with the Organizer.</p>

            <h2>7. Behavior at Events</h2>
            <p>When attending an event, you must follow:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Venue rules</li>
                <li>Organizer policies</li>
                <li>Age restrictions</li>
                <li>Local laws</li>
                <li>Safety requirements</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Organizers or venues may deny entry or remove attendees for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unsafe behavior</li>
                <li>Intoxication</li>
                <li>Rule violations</li>
                <li>Security concerns</li>
            </ul>
            <p>OpenSeat is not responsible for entry decisions.</p>

            <h2>8. User Content and License</h2>
            <p>If you submit, upload, or share any content on or through the Platform — including reviews, comments, images, or feedback — you retain ownership of that content but grant OpenSeat a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, display, reproduce, modify, distribute, and store it in connection with the operation and promotion of the Platform.</p>
            <p>You represent that you have the necessary rights to submit any such content and that it does not infringe on any third-party rights. OpenSeat may remove or disable content at its discretion if it is believed to violate these Terms or applicable law.</p>

            <h2>9. Your License to Use the Ticket</h2>
            <p>When you buy a ticket, you receive a <strong>limited, revocable license</strong> to attend the event. This license may be revoked by the Organizer if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You violate event rules</li>
                <li>You engage in misconduct</li>
                <li>Fraud is suspected</li>
                <li>The ticket was transferred or resold</li>
                <li>Entry is restricted by law</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>10. Acceptable Use of the Platform</h2>
            <p>You agree not to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Interfere with the app or website</li>
                <li>Try to bypass security features</li>
                <li>Attempt to copy or manipulate QR codes</li>
                <li>Use bots, scrapers, or automated tools</li>
                <li>Create fake accounts</li>
                <li>Engage in fraudulent activity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Violations may result in ticket invalidation or account suspension.</p>

            <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>To the fullest extent allowed by law:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>OpenSeat is not responsible for event conditions, schedule changes, content, or safety.</li>
                <li>We are not liable for travel costs, loss of enjoyment, or indirect damages.</li>
                <li>Our maximum liability is limited to the fees you paid to OpenSeat, not the ticket price (which goes to the Organizer).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>12. Waiver of Liability</h2>
            <p>You understand and agree that OpenSeat is not responsible for the planning, organization, safety, or execution of any event listed on the Platform. OpenSeat does not control event conditions, venue policies, crowd behavior, weather, or any other risk factors.</p>
            <p>By purchasing or using a ticket through OpenSeat, you voluntarily assume all risks associated with attending the event, including the risk of injury, illness, property damage, or other loss.</p>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive and release OpenSeat and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, or expenses — including legal fees — arising out of or in connection with the event you attend.</p>

            <h2>13. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>
            <p>Before initiating any legal action, you agree to first contact OpenSeat at <a href="mailto:contact@openseat.cc">contact@openseat.cc</a> to attempt to resolve the issue informally.</p>
            <p>If a dispute cannot be resolved within 30 days, you agree that any claim, dispute, or controversy arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Platform will be resolved through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except as allowed below.</p>
            <p>This arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and applies to all claims, whether based in contract, tort, statute, or otherwise. The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator through the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be held in Clark County, Washington, or another location mutually agreed upon.</p>
            <p>You and OpenSeat each waive the right to a jury trial and to participate in a class action.</p>
            <p>Either party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent actual or threatened misuse of intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Platform.</p>
            <p>If this arbitration clause is found to be unenforceable in any way, the remainder of these Terms will still apply, and any dispute must be brought exclusively in the courts located in Clark County, Washington.</p>

            <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the <strong>State of Washington</strong>, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.</p>
            <p>Except as otherwise provided in the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section above, any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to these Terms must be brought in the state or federal courts located in <strong>Clark County, Washington</strong>, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of those courts.</p>

            <h2>15. Platform Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>OpenSeat acts solely as a neutral intermediary and technology provider. We do not endorse, control, or supervise Organizers or the events listed on the Platform.</p>
            <p>By using the Platform, you acknowledge that OpenSeat has no responsibility for the actions, inactions, or representations of any Organizer or third party, including event-related safety, compliance, customer service, or refund handling.</p>
            <p>OpenSeat expressly disclaims all liability arising from or related to any event, transaction, or dispute between Buyers and Organizers.</p>

            <h2>16. Force Majeure</h2>
            <p>OpenSeat is not responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performing, any obligation under these Terms due to events beyond its reasonable control. This includes, but is not limited to, natural disasters, power outages, internet failures, acts of government, civil unrest, labor shortages, pandemics, or disruptions in third-party services.</p>
            <p>Such events do not entitle any party to a refund, damages, or compensation from OpenSeat.</p>

            <h2>17. Severability</h2>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. The invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted to reflect the original intent as closely as possible, in accordance with applicable law.</p>

            <h2>18. Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>We may update or modify these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by email, app notification, or by posting an updated version on our website. Continued use of the Platform after such changes means you accept the updated Terms.</p>
            <p>The current version of the Terms will always be available on our website.</p>

            <h2>19. Contact Us</h2>
